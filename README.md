# Treasury Liquidity UI — Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the UI locally.

1) Start the backend application:
    - In your IDE, locate the backend's main class (e.g., `Application.java`).
    - Right‑click `Application.java` and choose “Run” to start the backend server.
    - Ensure it’s running locally (commonly on http://localhost:8080).
2) Open a terminal in the UI folder and install dependencies (first time only): bash npm install
3) Start the dev server: bash npm run start
4) Open the app in your browser: http://localhost:4200
